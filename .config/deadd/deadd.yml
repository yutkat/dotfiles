### Monitor on which the notification center/notifications will be
### printed. If "follow-mouse" is set true, this does nothing.

notification:
  ### If true, markup (<u>, <i>, <b>, <a>) will be displayed properly
  use-markup: true

  ### If true, html entities (&#38; for &, &#37; for %, etc) will be
  ### parsed properly. This is useful for chromium-based apps, which
  ### tend to send these in notifications.
  parse-html-entities: true

  dbus:

    ### If noti-closed messages are enabled, the sending application
    ### will know that a notification was closed/timed out. This can
    ### be an issue for certain applications, that overwrite
    ### notifications on status updates (e.g. Spotify on each
    ### song). When one of these applications thinks, the notification
    ### has been closed/timed out, they will not overwrite existing
    ### notifications but send new ones. This can lead to redundant
    ### notifications in the notification center, as the close-message
    ### is send regardless of the notification being persisted.
    send-noti-closed: false

  app-icon:

    ### If set to true: If no icon is passed by the app_icon parameter
    ### and no application "desktop-entry"-hint is present, deadd will
    ### try to guess the icon from the application name (if present).
    guess-icon-from-name: true

    ### The display size of the application icons in the notification 
    ### pop-ups and in the notification center
    icon-size: 20

  image:

    ### The maximal display size of images that are part of
    ### notifications for notification pop-ups and in the notification
    ### center
    size: 100

    ### The margin around the top, bottom, left, and right of
    ### notification images.
    margin-top: 15
    margin-bottom: 15
    margin-left: 15
    margin-right: 0

  ### Apply modifications to certain notifications:
  ### Each modification rule needs a "match" and either a "modify" or
  ### a "script" entry.
  modifications:
  ### Match:
  ### Matches the notifications against these rules. If all of the
  ### values (of one modification rule) match, the "modify"/"script"
  ### part is applied.
  # - match:
      ### Possible match criteria:
      # title: "Notification title"
      # body: "Notification body"
      # time: "12:44"
      # app-name: "App name"
      # urgency: "low" # "low", "normal" or "critical"

    # modify:
      ### Possible modifications
      # title: "abc"
      # body: "abc"
      # app-name: "abc"
      # app-icon: "file:///abc.png"
      ### The timeout has three special values:
      ### timeout: 0 -> don't time out at all
      ### timeout: -1 -> use default timeout
      ### timeout: 1 -> don't show as pop-up
      ### timeout: >1 -> milliseconds until timeout
      # timeout: 1
      # margin-right: 10
      # margin-top: 10
      # image: "file:///abc.png"

      # send-noti-closed: false
      ### Remove action buttons from notifications
      # remove-actions: true
      ### Set the action-icons hint to true, action labels will then
      ### be intergreted as GTK icon names
      # action-icons: true
      ### List of actions, where the even elements (0, 2, ...) are the
      ### action name and the odd elements are the label
      # actions:
      #   - previous
      #   - media-skip-backward
      #   - play
      #   - media-playback-start
      #   - next
      #   - media-skip-forward
      ### Action commands, where the keys (e.g. "play") is the action
      ### name and the value is a program call that should be executed
      ### on action. Prevents sending of the action to the application.
      # action-commands:
      #   play: playerctl play-pause
      #   previous: playerctl previous
      #   next: playerctl next

      ### Add a class-name to the notification container, that can be
      ### used for specific styling of notifications using the
      ### deadd.css file
      # class-name: "abc"

  # - match:
      # app-name: "Chromium"

    ### Instead of modifying a notification directly, a script can be
    ### run, which will receive the notification as JSON on STDIN. It
    ### is expected to return JSON/YAML configuration that defines the
    ### modifications that should be applied. Minimum complete return
    ### value must be '{"modify": {}, "match": {}}'. Always leave the "match"
    ### object empty (technical reasons, i.e. I am lazy).
    # script: "linux-notification-center-parse-chromium"
  - match:

    ### Default timeout used for notifications in milli-seconds.  This can
    ### be overwritten with the "-t" option (or "--expire-time") of the
    ### notify-send command.
    default-timeout: 10000

    ### Defines after how many lines of text the body will be truncated. 
    ### Use 0 if you want to disable truncation.
    max-lines-in-body: 3

    ### Determines whether the GTK widget that displays the notification body
    ### in the notification popup will be hidden when empty. This is especially
    ### useful for transient notifications that display a progress bar.
    # hide-body-if-empty: false

    ### Monitor on which the notifications will be
    ### printed. If "follow-mouse" is set true, this does nothing.
    # monitor: 0

    ### If true, the notifications will open on the
    ### screen, on which the mouse is. Overrides the "monitor" setting.
    # follow-mouse: false

    click-behavior:

      ### The mouse button for dismissing a popup. Must be either "mouse1", 
      ### "mouse2", "mouse3", "mouse4", or "mouse5"
      dismiss: mouse1

      ### The mouse button for opening a popup with the default action.
      ### Must be either "mouse1", "mouse2", "mouse3", "mouse4", or "mouse5"
